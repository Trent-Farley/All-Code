1.  For my progrma, I saved user input into some variables. 
    These variables can easily be written into a file with 
    just saying with open... filename.write(f"stuff {variables})

2.  Try and except work by telling python to run a block of code
    and if an exception raises, then print some statement to the 
    user 

3.  My code for assignment 1 was pretty broken down, maybe more 
    error handling functions could be used. For assignment 2, the 
    radio code is pretty broken down as well, the only thing that 
    I would change is putting radio into a file. This I did, and it 
    ran very smoothly. 

4.  The if/else statement for the radio program works extremely well,
    and I could not find anything it did not catch. The error comes when 
    I write the informatioin into a file. The file creates an issue of 
    the program starting with FM while the file may say another mode. 

Part 2

1.  The hardest part of getting file I/O in this program was the way
    default_modes was handled. It was kind of frustrating, but  I figured
    out a really decent way of doing so. Once I baked up a solution, file 
    I/O was a breeze. 

2.  I am sure there is a better way to handle default_modes with a functions,
    but I could not figure it out. Other than that, the code is well broken 
    down and works well. 

3.  As mentioned before the if/else statement that is used catches all of the 
    bad input that I tried. THe only thing that does not work great is the mute
    function, since it does not know the difference between 0% and mute. 

Part 3

1.  As with every class, there are new concepts that are introduced and those 
    can be difficult at first and looking back they tend to be easier since 
    they have been practiced and integrated in my abilities today. I guess the 
    hardest concept for me to grasp still is he true meaning of object- oriented
    programming. I understand that the program treats these objects as something 
    that can not be touched but actually integrating this ideas is much different
    then functional programming.
