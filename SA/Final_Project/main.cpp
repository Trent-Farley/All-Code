/*
THE PLAN: 
Final Project? (Graph):
Create some tests before you start coding...
Implement a graph class with at least:
	a function to add a new node to the graph (addNode(nodeName))
	a function to add a new path between two nodes of the graph (addPath(source, destination))
	a function for a shortest path algorithm (shortestPath(source, destination))
	a function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example minSpanTree()).
	Analyze the complexity of all of your graph behaviors

IMPLEMENTATION:
As given by the instructions, I am going to need some functions to addnodes, addpath,
find shortest path and create min spanning tree. Using the idea of a node from the start,
I will only need it to have one direction, since I can have it going anywhere.
