I decided to use BS code since that is what I am used to. I tried Vim on a friendï¿½s computer and found that it works better than VS code, I just could not figure out how to set it up. A couple of extensions on vscode and I was good to go, with just clicking a play button working like a charm. On the command line, all I had to do was specify the file that I want to compile and the weird out file command to make a file that is possible to find. 
I am not a good drawer, so here is my "picture" of interactions of a computer. Usually the 
c program will be built and ran on an Application.
