Weekly Report-
This week was a lot of setup and for me that meant finding what visual studio code can do. 

Design-

This program will need to print off every data type. Using instruction from class, will also print off what each variable is called. Very different from python, each variable needs to be declared for which variable type it is. 
The goal of this project is to show us how c is different from other languages. This includes showing us the different data types as well as the rough structure of C. This also was good for me to see how code compiles since this is not something that I have dealt with. For a simple program such as this, there is no input, but it spat out all the information about the data types. 

Testing-

Testing was easy for this week, I just made sure everything compiled and printed out. 

Reflection-

For a simple program such as this, there was not much of a problem to be solved other than if this computer can compile code in C. Both items it did successfully and spat out wrong answers a couple of times, but it seemed to work after reading the weird %d stuff. I wish that I knew more languages before taking on this class, but all the concepts are broadly the same as python so with some google aid I am sure that I will pick it up quickly. SO far the weirdest thing has been worrying about bytes. I never really had to think about that before and this will most likely be a problem for me. I know that the compiler will be used for the whole class, so it should be fun to see how that works.
