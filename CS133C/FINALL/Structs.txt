A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is 
 a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines 
a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in a block of
 memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer, or 
 the struct declared name which returns the same address. (Wikipedia) 
 Structs are created like such:

     struct variable = {  
         any function/variables that you would like to be defined in one
         group of memory.
   } variable 

 variable.function can call the function defined in the struct to be used 
 for outside uses. Putting a struct in a struct is pretty simple and can be 
called just like the first one, bu saying variable.variable.attribute example

    struct airport {
        struct terminal{
            int people
        }term
        int planes
        }port;
    port.term.people = 52;
    port.planes=6;

Inside a terminal struct inside an airport struct and there are 52 
people in the terminal and 6 planes
