    Start of class- 
    went over some guides, one of them was a quick start guide (Learn Python in 10 mins)
    Talked about version control systems:
    What is a version control system (VCS)?
        A VCS is any control program that is able to branch code and be able to change. 
    Benefits of having VCS:
        --Easy Teamwork
        --On every commit, able to see every change
        --See when a bug is introduced and ammend it
        --Signal to other people that something is being tested
    Github:
        ## Some help on his homepage ##
        --Github has a lot of cool stuff, and this can be seen from his website. 
        $ He suggests to commiting often to github.
