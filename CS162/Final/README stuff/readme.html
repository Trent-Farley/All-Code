<h1>Python Final</h1>
<body>
<p class="off-t">
    As you may notice I have drastically improved over the term. It has been really 
<br>
    hard taking 3 Computer Science classes all at once, and I would not recommend it 
<br> 
    to anyone. Stating this however, all of the skills that I have learned from the C 
<br>
    helped me better understand Python and both of those really helped me learn javascript
<br>
    for web development in +- couople of weeks. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br><h2>The Program</h2>
<p class="on-t">
    That was a bit off topic, sorry. Here is the really important stuff. 
<br>
    For this final I decided to make a text editor, but it doesnt really incoorperate
<br>
    everything well mainly because I did not want to make something so disjoint. 
<br>
    I had everything else in there- try/except, inheritance, fileIO, UserIO, 
<br> 
    event driven programming and all of the correct coding habits. 
<br>
<br>
    For testing, I couldnt make a seperate driver that just made more files 
<br>
    or saved them, but I did make plenty and everything seemed to work. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
    Anyways- Thanks for the great term!
<br>
    I'll be in Data Structures & Algorithims next term!
